I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the School of Information, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Prof. Hong Chen. I am currently conducting research as a visiting student at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. Yang You. I earned my master’s degree from Renmin University of China in 2022 and my bachelor’s degree from Hebei University. During my master’s studies, I was supervised by Prof. Suyun Zhao.

My research focuses on unsupervised learning, weakly supervised learning, and open-set learning. To date, I have published two papers in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) and three papers in leading international AI conferences.

I welcome collaboration opportunities. If you are interested in joint research on open-set learning or other emerging topics, please feel free to reach out to me at [Email](du_pan@163.com).
