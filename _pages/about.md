I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Information, Renmin University of China](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJVLD1oAAAAJ&hl=en). I am currently conducting research as a visiting student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, advised by [Prof. Yang You](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jF4dPZwAAAAJ&hl=en). I earned my master’s degree from Renmin University of China in 2022 and my bachelor’s degree from Hebei University. During my master’s studies, I was supervised by [Prof. Suyun Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nbvw280AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research focuses on unsupervised learning, weakly supervised learning, and open-set learning. To date, I have published two papers in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) and three papers in leading international AI conferences.

I welcome collaboration opportunities. If you are interested in joint research on open-set learning or other emerging topics, please feel free to reach out to me at [Email](mailto:du_pan@163.com).
